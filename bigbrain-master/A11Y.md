The accessibility of a page

Font size and type: Use clear, easy-to-read fonts, proper fonts size and Bold key function fonts

Page structure: Simple pages, no other useless buttons to affect users, obvious buttons and prompts

Forms and input fields: Provide clear labels for all form fields in searchquiz page, updatequiz page and quizdetail page.For all the display pages, I have considered the key point of being concise and clear, so that users can quickly and easily get started using the webpage
